# Self-Learning-Robot

[Q Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. The goal of Q-learning is to learn a policy, which tells an agent what action to take under what circumstances.


A bot is made with Raspberry Pi Controller with IR sensors to be used as a Reinforcement Learning agent.

This project was inspired by - [An introduction to Reinforcement Learning](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/an-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-4339519de419)


### Our Approach

Our goal is to make this agent learn the policy to follow a line (detected by its sensors) by learning from its own mistakes.
We do not explicitly provide any instructions to the bot. We only provide a free environment for the agent to interact and the environment will present reward for each action of the agent.
